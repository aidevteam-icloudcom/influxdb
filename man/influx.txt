NAME
----
influx - InfluxDB client

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]

'influx' (-v | --version)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'influx' is the command line program for interacting with an InfluxDB server.

In the first form, the program starts a CLI that can be used to write data or query the database. The command line is described in *COMMAND LINE*.

In the second form, this will execute a single command, usually a query. This is the equivalent of starting the command line, running one command, and then exiting.

In the third form, this imports a previously exported database to the database.

The fourth form outputs the version of the command line and then immediately exits.
