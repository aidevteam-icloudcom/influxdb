# Running InfluxDB with Docker

This folder contains everything you need to get up and running with InfluxDB and Docker.

To get started, set a value for INFLUXDB_PASSWORD in the `docker-compose.yml` file and then run the following command:

    docker-compose up

This will set up InfluxDB and complete the onboarding steps so that you aready to go using the web UI or the command line interface.

For more information about getting started, check out the next steps in the [InfluxDB Documentation](https://v2.docs.influxdata.com/v2.0/get-started/#next-steps).
